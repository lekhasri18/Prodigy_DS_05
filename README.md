The code and process aim to analyze traffic accident data through a systematic application of machine learning techniques. It begins by loading a dataset containing synthetic traffic accident records, allowing for an initial exploration of its structure and content. This exploratory step helps in understanding the variables involved and their potential impact on accident severity prediction.

The analyze_accidents function plays a pivotal role by visualizing key aspects of the data. It generates visual representations of accident distributions based on weather conditions, road conditions, severity levels, and time of day. Additionally, it maps accident hotspots using geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), providing insights into where accidents tend to cluster spatially.

Next, the preprocess_data function handles data preparation tasks essential for machine learning. It encodes categorical variables like weather conditions, road conditions, and accident severity into numeric format, which is crucial for training predictive models. This function also splits the dataset into training and testing subsets, ensuring that model performance can be accurately assessed on unseen data.

The core of the analysis lies in the train_evaluate_models function, where multiple machine learning models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—are trained on the prepared training data. Each model is evaluated using standard metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. These metrics collectively gauge how well each model predicts the severity of traffic accidents, offering a comprehensive view of their strengths and weaknesses.

The final output presents the evaluation results for each model, detailing their respective performance across the metrics. This allows for an informed decision on which model best suits the task of predicting accident severity based on the dataset. Ultimately, this structured approach—from initial data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation—enables stakeholders to derive actionable insights for improving road safety measures and accident prevention strategies.
